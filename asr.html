            <p align="center">The Harmandar Sahib also known as Darbar Sahib (Punjabi pronunciation: [dəɾbaːɾ saːh(ɪ)b] ("Abode of God", "Exaltedy Court"), is a Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the preeminent pilgrimage site
                of Sikhism. It is usually called the Golden Temple in English, because it is plated with gold.
                The Gurdwara sahib is built around a man-made pool (Sarovar) that was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577.
                Guru Arjan, the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mian Mir - a Muslim Pir of Lahore, to lay its foundation
                stone in 1589. In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib, calling the site
                Ath Sath Tirath (lit. "shrine of 68 pilgrimages"). <br><br>
                The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after
                it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Muslim armies from Afghanistan
                and the Mughal Empire. The army led by Ahmad Shah Abdali, for example, demolished it in 1757 and again
                in 1762, then filled the pool with garbage. The construction work of the present day Harmandir Sahib
                took place in 1764 under the leadership of Sultan-e-Quam Sardar Jassa Singh 1718-1783 and other leading
                Sikh Misl Sardars and Jagirdars under Kaar Seva, Sikh congregations assembled at Amritsar to help
                rebuild Darbar Sahib.<br><br> Harmandir Sahib was finally completed in 1776. Maharaja Ranjit Singh visited Darbar
                Sahib in 1802 after seizing Amritsar from Sardar Gurdit Singh Dhillon and his mother Mai Sukkha of Bhangi Sikh
                Misl. Maharaja laid it in marble and copper between 1820-1831, and overlaid the sanctum with gold foil by
                1830. This has led to the name Golden Temple.</p>

            <h3>History of Durgiana Temple</h3><br>
            <p>

                It was built in 1921 by Guru Harsai Mal Kapoor in the architectural style of the Sikh Golden Temple.
                The newly built temple was inaugurated by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.

                Even though Amritsar is not declared a Holy city, restrictions are in force prohibiting sale of tobacco,
                liquor and meat within a radius of 200 metres (660 ft) around this temple and the Golden Temple.The temple
            is situated near the Lohgarh gate, in Amritsar, in the Indian state of Punjab . It is very close to the Amritsar
            Railway station, and is about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) from the bus station.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> The Durgiana Temple (ਦੁਰਗਿਆਨਾ ਮੰਦਿਰ), also known as Lakshmi Narayan Temple, Durga Tirath and Sitla Mandir,
                is a premier temple situated in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[1] Though a Hindu temple, its
                architecture is similar to the Golden Temple. This temple derives its name from the Goddess Durga,
                the chief Goddess deified and worshipped here. Idols of Goddess Laksmi (goddess of wealth) and Vishnu
                (the protector of the world) are also deified here and worshipped.

            <p>Wagah (Urdu: واہگہ‎, Shahmukhi Punjabi: واہگہ) or Wahga is a village and union council (UC 181) located in the
                Wahga Zone of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The town is famous for the Wagah border ceremony and also serves as a
                goods transit terminal and a railway station between Pakistan and India.[2] Wagah is situated 600 metres
                (2,000 ft) west of the border and lies on the historic Grand Trunk Road between Lahore and Amritsar in
                India. The border is located 24 kilometres (15 mi) from Lahore and 32 kilometres (20 mi) from Amritsar.
                It is also 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from the bordering village of Attari.</p>
            <h3>Border Crossing Ceremony</h3>
            <p>The Wagah-Attari border ceremony happens at the border gate, two hours before sunset each day.
                The flag ceremony is conducted by the Pakistan Rangers and Indian Border Security Force (BSF), similar
                to the retreat ceremonies at Ganda Singh Wala/Hussainiwala border crossing and Mahavir/Sadqi International
                Parade Ground border crossing. Following India's erection of a 360ft (110m) flagpole on their side of the
                border in Attari, in August 2017, a 400ft (122m) flag was installed on the Wagah side. The flagpole in Wagah
                is considered the tallest in South Asia. The pole in Attari is the largest in India.</p>
